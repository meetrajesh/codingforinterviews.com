Solutions to the weekly coding problems on codingforinterviews.com

Problems
========

Week 4 - 3-Jan-2013 - linked_list.php
--------------------

Implement a simple singly-linked list data structure in your favorite language.

Then, implement all the following linked list interview questions:

    1. Write a function to remove a list's 3rd from last element. Challenge: can you do it in a single list traversal?
    2. Write a function to remove all duplicates from a linked list. Challenge: can you do it without storing any extra data?
    3. Write a function to detect a loop in a linked list.

Week 3 - 24-Dec-2012 - merge_sort.php
--------------------

Write a function that merges an array of already sorted arrays, producing one
large, still sorted array. For example, your input might be:

[[0, 5, 8, 9], [1, 2, 7], [10]]

And you should return:

[0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]


Week 2 - 17-Dec-2012 - check_binary_search_tree.php
--------------

Write a function that returns whether a given binary tree is a valid binary search tree. Use your favorite programming language. For extra credit, write your response on paper or your gigantic Mark Zuckerberg-approved whiteboard. You likely won't have an IDE at your next interview.


Week 1 - 10-Dec-2012 - hash_table.php
-----------

For this week, take a stab at implementing a hash table in your favorite programming language. That is to say, write a data structure that will let you map keys to values and give you amortized constant-time access. Your implementation should have some form of collision handling--what do you do when your hash function maps two keys to the same place?

This is a game of tabooâ€”don't use any associative arrays (dictionaries, hash.*s, {}s, PHP array(k=>v)s etc) in your implementation. Time yourself, and time box your attempt to one hour. As Yegge notes: "You should be able to implement one using only arrays in your favorite language, in about the space of one interview."
